My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said 'you know what? That's fine.', paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.\n\nBottom line: DO NOT GO HERE.

We were not disappointed.\n\nI am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.\n\nI ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.\n\nTldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.\n\nUpdate: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney.\",\"date\":\"2018-02-01 19:15:00\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that 'Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick' (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nFOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good. I wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness. (I personally hate when waiters\/waitresses, come back every 5 minutes, is everything ok is everything ok...sheesh can i enjoy my meal?) \n\nAnyway like i said, i had a horrible experience in vegas and this and the concert i went to see were the best parts about my trip, very glad i blessed up on this place.\n\nP.S.  Take notice, i have never eaten in a celebrity chef's restaurant and noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on any table.  ha just a fun tidbit, i thought that was funny and very interesting, almost as if the chef is subtly saying 'you will not mess up my dish with your spices'\",\"date\":\"2009-10-13 09:50:48\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

It's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. First experience was very positive - would definitely return!\n\nATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.\n\nSERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.\n\nPRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)\n\n\nFOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.\n\nHere's the pizza we ordered:\n\nPeking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.\n\nMargherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more 'special' toppings instead.\n\nShall return, and\/or try other locations.\",\"date\":\"2017-06-06 19:04:10\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

Oh, how things have changed.\n\nThere are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. \n\nThe 'Space Lounge' is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.\n\nWith their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their 'big draw' on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.\n\nThe arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  \n\nThere's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was 'ha ha' funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.\n\nLadies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.\n\nAs critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called 'Triumph' there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.\n\nThe sad part is, Hilton's one of those 'history rich' casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.\n\nThis place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.\",\"date\":\"2011-01-09 00:09:50\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

First things first you can order chow menu instead of rice, which was a hard decision but I went with the chow main. The staff is very friendly and there is a very cute fish tank while you wait, anyways pick up the food and get home. This stuff is amazing. The red bell peppers in here are amazing. They are fresh and lightly sautéed, as well as the broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. This is a great portion for what you are ordering and the meat is nice big slices. The sauce is this spicy brown concoction with lil Brown beans that are perfectly spicy. The chow mein is seriously amazing and also a great side size portion. These dumplings have to be some of my favorites in the valley and I have tried my fair share. This is incredibly worth it, better than most Chinese take out by far. It isn't your typical take out.

I've been to the one in Thousand Oaks, CA a few times and thought I would give this location a try. It is located in the Crystals shopping plaza that is next to the Aria hotel. This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best. \n\nI made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. \n\nI still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony. \n\nWe also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). \n\nDessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. \nThis is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal. I highly recommend it.\",\"date\":\"2012-12-04 20:43:19\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. \n\nThe decor was comforting in a British pub style.

Prior to this, my closest convenient neighborhood market was Rollin's Market with its rotting bell peppers and frozen Banquet dinners.  There's always Fry's or Safeway, but I like hitting up a small little market on the corner of my neighborhood and build a rapport with the employees and owners as part of establishing a community.\n\nThe dude who runs the place will sometimes thrown in a tomato or apple or lime in with your bag of groceries.  Hey, free apple.  \n\nNot everything they have is permanent.  Sometimes something new will be there, and the next week it will be gone, but in a way, I like that about it.  You go in there, and they have these Indian pickles made from wild cucumbers.  Next week, in its place, will be garlic pickles or something else awesome.\n\nFor what the place is, it's marvelous.  It's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets.  It's nice having a little market where you can pop in and buy polish sausage from a local farmer, organic soup, goat cheese with kalamata olives but you can also get your regular ass Skippy peanut butter and Campbell's soup.\",\"date\":\"2010-01-08 18:58:51\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

He didn't know why he was calling and it seems that he was just told to call me without any details. I explained the situation, and he told me that parts rust and that's how cars work. I asked if it's normal for parts to rust and seize after 5 months of use, and he didn't have anything to say. He then said that I could have brought the car back to them so they could 'fix' it (actually do the work this time), but I told him the work had already been done by my regular mechanic. He said it was too bad, because they have no way to compensate me. I explained that this was fine and I'll just continue to tell everyone I meet what thieves they are. He offered to have the regional manager call me, but it would take a couple of days because they are busy. I said this was fine, but it's been a week and a half and I still haven't heard from them.

The place is just so laid back, with the giant apple-shaped apple stand on the side of the building, which used to sell candy apples and apple cider, though I haven't seen it open in some time. Maybe I've just been arriving at the wrong time? There's also currently a petting zoo on the other side of the building, with a coin-operated machine that dispenses feed for the animals. \n\nInside is your typical tiny grocery store\/butcher. They do sell many specialty items that you may not find at a regular grocery store, along with pretty much anything Apple that you can think of. But all of that is foreplay to the main attraction: THE PIES. They have their own little pie patrol that bakes the freshest, most delicious homemade pies, I don't think I've ever bought one that wasn't 100% fresh and amazing. \nI've never really been a pie-guy, but this place is different. And if you don't want an entire pie, they also sell slices. Their strawberry rhubarb is amazing. I've never Jason Biggs'd a pie before, but the s.r. has definitely gotten a couple of suggestive glances from me.\n\nAs for the service, the employees are always very sweet, helpful, and have been known to give out free apple cider at times.\n\nI also can't complete this review without mentioning the Apple band. That's right, a Chuck-E-Cheese-esque Apple band is occasionally available to play on their mini-stage...you just have to catch them at the right time.

I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, 'The Buffet' as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.\n\nFirst, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nI hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck\",\"date\":\"2013-09-04 00:28:40\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. \nNeo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.\nYesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.\nThe unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was 'Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled' (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  ' if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool'.  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said 'Let's take the disabled veteran out of it'.  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a 'Show of Force.' We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant\/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  \n\nNeo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are \nfalse. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. \n\nSecondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  \nLastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  \n\nThe entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire 'rigged system'  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. \n\nI asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.\nAdditionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said 'thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.\",\"date\":\"2016-08-13 01:29:59\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! \n\nI first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.\n\nSo when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.\n\nThe main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  \n\nThe DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.\n\nI would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.\n\nNote:  There is a 'bar' in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.\n\n\n\nReview #2 of 2014\",\"date\":\"2014-01-17 04:05:45\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!\nI don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. \nThe sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. \nOverall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful\/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight 'drawbacks', the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.\",\"date\":\"2015-06-08 18:56:14\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

Really???? What a great way to handle an error in the production of the glasses.  When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...'Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.'  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr\/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.  I did call back and spoke with an Office Mgr, who stated she would look into the matter and get back to me, but never did.  So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. \n Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.\n(Note: using fake name here for privacy protection from internet identity thieves.)\",\"date\":\"2018-07-17 00:21:32\"}" >> "$TEST_REVIEWS"

We ate here on the day before New Year's Eve so that may have been why we easily got a reservation at prime dinner time.  Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. \n\nSourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  One thing I hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so I really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.\n\nFor a starter, we split the Terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.\n\nFor our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)  Mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.\n\nMark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  Such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  The french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.
